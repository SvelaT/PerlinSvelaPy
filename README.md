# PerlinSvelaPy

## What is this project?

It's a simple python file that generates a map based on the perlin noise algorithm.

## How do I test this project?

You will need Python installed on your machine and to run it you use the following commands:

```
cd [replace with path of the repository]
python ./generateMapPerlin.py
```

The command will take a while to run but in the end you should have a new file named generatedMap.png.

Feel free to mess with the code and generate different maps.

If you want a deeper explanation of the algorithm, I've published a video on youtube explaining the logic behind it:
